# lite-dl
Python script to download any literotica story.

Don't worry about the acuracy. If something got downloaded without an error, it's whole thing. No more. No less. Single stories can't be downloaded. Whatever the chapter you give as the link, whole series will be downloaded.

# How To

 1. `git clone https://github.com/nova9/lite-dl.git`
 2. `Go into the folder`
 2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 4. `python3 main.py "<LINK OF THE STORY>"`
>Link should be like this
> https://www.literotica.com/s/a-challenge-part-01

 5. `DONE!`
